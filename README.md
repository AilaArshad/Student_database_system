# Student Database Management System

This is a simple **Student Database Management System** written in Python. The script allows you to add student names, assigns them unique IDs, and performs various operations like displaying the total number of students, calculating the total length of all names combined, and identifying the longest and shortest student names.

## Features
- Add student names and assign each student a unique ID.
- Prevents duplicate student names.
- Displays the list of students with their IDs.
- Calculates and displays:
  - Total number of students.
  - Total length of all student names combined.
  - The student with the longest name.
  - The student with the shortest name.

## How It Works
1. The script runs in a loop, continuously asking for new student names.
2. If a name is entered, it gets added to the list with a unique ID.
3. If the user types `'stop'`, the data entry process ends.
4. After the loop ends, the script prints the complete list of students with IDs, the total number of students, and some additional information about the names (length, longest, and shortest).
